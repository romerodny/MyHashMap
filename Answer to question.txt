Using two hash functions makes it so that an entry will added to the shorter of 
the two lists. This in turn insures we will be keeping lists from getting too large,
reducing the number of collisions. When using a single hash function, you don't get 
the a chance to choose between two locations on the table, meaning collisions will be
more frequent.
